*SGF to GIF*

* Converts the main line of an SGF file to an animated GIF.
* Can split the output into a series of GIFs (e.g. move 1-100, 101-200, etc)
* Can handle a directory (non-recursive).
* Optional coordinates and move numbers.
* Adjustable speed and board size.
* Stores the animation as a series of changes to keep filesize down.
* Written in Golang, using standard library only.
* Try `./sgf_to.gif.exe --help` for options.
